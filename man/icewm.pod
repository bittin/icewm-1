=head2 NAME

 icewm - lightweight X11 window manager

=head2 SYNOPSIS

B<icewm> [I<OPTIONS>]

=head2 DESCRIPTION

B<icewm> is a small and fast window manager for the X11 window system.  It
is best started by L<icewm-session(1)>, which also starts L<icewmbg(1)>.

B<icewm> is called I<re-parenting>, because it draws frames around
application windows.  Drag this frame with the mouse, to move or resize
a window.

Because windows may overlap, B<icewm> is also a stacking window manager.
Many windows may exist, some hidden behind others.

B<icewm> supports a configurable number of virtual desktops.  These are
called workspaces. Related windows are grouped on a dedicated workspace.
By switching between workspaces, the user can attend to different tasks,
while keeping oversight.  This is supported by a task bar and a pager.

The installation comes with several themes. Choose a theme via a menu.
Install extra themes automatically with the B<--install> option.

B<icewm> is compliant with the ICCCM and EWMH window manager specifications.

=head2 PROGRAMS

The B<icewm> package includes several programs:

=over

=item L<icewm(1)>

The actual window manager. It positions application windows on screen
and decorates them with borders. It gives input focus to the current
active application. B<icewm> supports different focus modes, which are
explained below. It draws a small task bar at the bottom of the screen,
that gives easy access to programs, to virtual desktops, to active
applications, and to a small set of monitoring applets.

=item L<icewmbg(1)>

The background setting application. It can assign plain background color
or images in different formats to the X background.  Each workspace can
have its own background.  It supports semitransparency. Semitransparent
background image and colour can be configured. When the background image
has changed then L<icewmbg(1)> can be notified to update the background.
Multi-head monitor setups are fully supported.  See the L<icewmbg(1)>.

=item L<icewm-session(1)>

L<icewm-session(1)> is the preferred program to start the IceWM system.
It first loads additional environment variables from the optional
F<env> file. Then it starts L<icewmbg(1)> and B<icewm>. It also runs
the F<startup> script and implements basic session management.
On termination the F<shutdown> script will be run first, then
L<icewm-session(1)> will terminate B<icewm> and L<icewmbg(1)>.
L<icewm-session(1)> will also start the optional L<icesound(1)>
if you give it the B<--sound> option.  See L<icewm-session(1)>.

=item L<icesh(1)>

A powerful tool to control window properties and to interact with the
window manager. It is typically used in shell scripts. See L<icesh(1)>.

=item L<icehelp(1)>

A small document browser that is used by B<icewm> to display the
'IceWM manual' and some man pages.

=item L<icewmhint(1)>

A utility for passing IceWM-specific window options to B<icewm>.
The options are used to configure the first application that is started
subsequently.  See L<icewmhint(1)>.

=item L<icesound(1)>

Plays audio files on GUI events that are raised by B<icewm>.
It supports ALSA, AO and OSS.  See the L<icesound(1)> man page.

=item L<icewm-menu-fdo(1)>

Generate an B<icewm> menu with executable desktop applications
according to XDG specifications. See the L<icewm-menu-fdo(1)> man page.

=item L<icewm-set-gnomewm(1)>

Configures GNOME to start IceWM instead of its own WM.

=back

=head2 OPTIONS

=head2 COMMON OPTIONS

Each of the IceWM executables supports the following options:

=over

=item B<-c>, B<--config>=I<FILE>

Use I<FILE> as the source of configuration options.  By default B<icewm>
looks for a file named F<preferences>.  This is a readable text file
that can be modified with the help of a text editor.

=item B<-t>, B<--theme>=I<NAME>

Use I<NAME> as the name of the B<icewm> theme to use.  A theme defines
the look and feel of B<icewm>, like colors, fonts and buttons.

=item B<-d>, B<--display>=I<DISPLAY>

Connect to the X11 server on I<DISPLAY>.  By default
the environment variable C<DISPLAY> is used.

=item B<-o>, B<--output=FILE>

Redirect all output to I<FILE>.
A leading tilde or environment variable is expanded.

=item B<--sync>

This option specifies to use a slower synchronous communication mode
with the X11 server.  This is irrelevant for normal use.

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Gives a complete list of all the available command-line options with
some very brief explanation.

=item B<-V>, B<--version>

Shows the software release version for this program.

=back

=head2 ICEWM OPTIONS

The B<icewm> program supports some additional options:

=over

=item B<-a>, B<--alpha>

Use a 32-bit visual for translucency. This can also be set in
the preferences file as C<Alpha=1>.

=item B<--replace>

Instructs B<icewm> to replace an existing window manager.  Provided that
the window manager being replaced is ICCCM 2.0 compliant, once it
notices that it is to be replaced it will cease operations and typically
stop execution.  This allows B<icewm> to establish itself as the only
active window manager.

=item B<-r>, B<--restart>

Tell B<icewm> to restart itself. This reloads the configuration from
file. If no window manager is active, then it starts one.

=item B<-s>, B<--splash>=I<IMAGE>

Briefly show I<IMAGE> on startup in the center of the screen.
This can also be set in the preferences file as Splash=C<image.jpg>.

=item B<--configured>

Shows a list of configuration options that were enabled when B<icewm>
was compiled from source code.  This can be helpful if one suspects some
functionality may be missing.

=item B<--directories>

Gives a list of directories where B<icewm> will look for configuration
data.  This list is printed in the actual order in which B<icewm> uses
it to search for configuration files.

=item B<-l>, B<--list-themes>

B<icewm> will search all the configuration directories for theme files
and print a list of all found themes.

=item B<-i>, B<--install>=I<THEME>

Install I<THEME> from icewm-extra and exit. When I<THEME> is I<list>,
print a listing of available themes to install. This option requires
the presence of the I<lzip>, I<tar> and I<wget> or I<curl> commands.

=item B<-p>, B<--postpreferences>

This gives a long list of all the internal B<icewm> options with their
actual values after B<icewm> has processed all of the configuration and
theme files. In some advanced scenarios this can be helpful to inspect
which configuration was chosen or whether option formatting was correct.

=item B<--rewrite-preferences>

Overwrite an existing preferences file with an icewm default preferences,
but preserve all modifications insofar they deviate from the defaults.

=item B<--extensions>

Give a list of the current X extensions, their versions and status.

=item B<--trace>=I<conf>,I<font>,I<icon>,I<prog>,I<systray>

Enable tracing of the paths that are used to load configuration,
fonts, icons, executed programs, and/or system tray applets.

=back

=head2 USAGE

=head2 TASKBAR

On startup B<icewm> launches the task bar at the bottom of the screen.
The task bar consists from left to right  of the following components:

The I<Menu> button in the lower left corner gives access to the B<icewm>
root menu. This menu has sub-menus to start applications, to control
B<icewm> settings, and the B<icewm> I<Logout> menu.

The I<Show Desktop> button unmaps all application windows to fully
uncover the desktop.

The I<Window List Menu> button gives access to a menu with a list of
active windows for the current workspace and a list of workspaces
with sub-menus for their active application windows.

The I<Toolbar> is a list of icons for applications that are defined in
the toolbar configuration file.

The I<Workspace Pane> shows one button for each workspace.  The current
workspace is indicated by a pressed button.  Clicking another workspace
switches to that workspace.  Press left mouse, then the Shift key, then
release the left mouse, takes the current window to that workspace.
Press left, then Alt, then release left, moves only the focused window
to other workspace, without changing the current workspace.

The workspaces are defined in the F<preferences> file.  To change a name
for only this session, double-click, edit the name and hit Enter.
When C<PagerShowPreview> is turned on, a small graphical window summary
for each workspace is shown. They support drag-and-drop: dragging a
Firefox tab to a workspace button changes the current workspace.
Then releasing it moves that tab to a new window in that workspace.

The I<Task Pane> consists of a list of wide buttons for each application
that is running on the current workspace, or all workspaces if
C<TaskBarShowAllWindows=1>.  Each task button shows the
application icon and the application title.  The active application is
indicated by a pressed button.  This is the application that has input
focus.  Pressing another button activates that application: it is
brought to the foreground and receives input focus.  Other mouse
controlled activities on the window buttons are: dragging window buttons
with the left mouse button to rearrange the order, closing the application
window with C<Alt> + middle button, lowering the application window with
C<Ctrl> + middle button, or bringing the application window to the current
workspace with C<Shift> + middle button if C<TaskBarShowAllWindows=1>.

If there are not many application buttons then a stretch of plain task
bar is visible.  Clicking on it with the right mouse button gives the
task bar menu.  Even with a full task pane, this menu can be usually
accessed by right-clicking the bottom right corner of the taskbar.

The I<Tray Applet> shows system tray objects.

The I<APM Applet> shows battery power status.

The I<Net Applet> shows network activity.  Network devices to monitor
are given by the C<NetworkStatusDevice> option.

The I<Memory Applet> monitors memory usage.

The I<CPU Applet> monitors processor utilization.

The I<Mailbox Applet> monitors mailbox status changes.
See the section MAILBOX MONITORING below.

The I<Clock Applet> shows the current time and date.  It is configured
by the C<TimeFormat> option.

The I<Task Bar Collapse> button collapses the task bar and hides it.

Not all B<icewm> applets may show up on the task bar.  They must have
been enabled during configuration of the B<icewm> software.  Their
appearance is also controlled by options in the F<preferences> file.

=head2 INPUT FOCUS

Of all visible windows only one can be the active window.  This is the
window that has input focus.  It is the primary receiver of keyboard
and mouse events and hence one can interact with the application that
created that window.  A primary task of a window manager is to allow the
user to switch input focus between different windows.  The primary means
to do this is the mouse pointer.  By moving the mouse pointer over the
screen to another window, and perhaps also by clicking on a window,
input focus can be directed.

The C<FocusMode> option controls the way B<icewm> gives input focus to
applications.  It is initialized by the F<focus_mode> configuration
file.  The focus mode is set via the I<Focus> menu.  B<icewm> supports
six focus models:

=over

=item B<1. Click-to-focus>

The default focus mode.  In this mode changing input focus requires to
click a window with the left mouse button. The window is raised if
needed.  When an application requests focus its task pane button
flashes.  This gives the option to honor this request or to ignore it.
When a new application window appears it automatically receives focus.
Also when a hidden application raises to the front it receives focus.

=item B<2. Sloppy-mouse-focus>

Sets input focus merely by moving the mouse pointer over a window.  It
is called sloppy, because if the mouse then leaves the window and moves
to the desktop background the input focus remains with the last active
window.  When a window receives focus it is raised.  When an application
requests focus its task pane button flashes.  A new application or an
application that raises to the front automatically receives focus.

=item B<3. Explicit-focus>

Focus is even more user-controlled than B<Click-to-focus>.  When a
window receives focus it is not raised by default, unless the frame
border is clicked.  No flashing occurs when an application requests
focus.  When a new application window appears it does not receive focus.
Only by explicit clicking on a window is focus directed.

=item B<4. Strict-mouse-focus>

Like B<Sloppy> but focus remains with the last window. New applications
don't receive focus and are mapped behind other windows.  When an
application raises to the front it still does not get focus.

=item B<5. Quiet-sloppy-focus>

Like B<Sloppy> but no disturbing flashing occurs on the task bar when an
application requests focus.

=item B<6. Custom-mode>

A focus mode that is defined by the following ten options:
C<ClickToFocus>,
C<FocusOnAppRaise>,
C<RequestFocusOnAppRaise>,
C<RaiseOnFocus>,
C<RaiseOnClickClient>,
C<FocusChangesWorkspace>,
C<FocusOnMap>,
C<FocusOnMapTransient>,
C<FocusOnMapTransientActive>,
C<MapInactiveOnTop>.

All non-Custom focus modes override these ten options.

=back

Apart from the mouse, B<icewm> supports changing input focus in two
ways by keyboard.  By pressing C<Alt+Esc> or C<Alt+Shift+Esc>,
input focus is immediately changed to the next or previous window,
which will be raised to make it fully visible. The other method
involves the quick switch.

=head2 QUICK SWITCH

The B<QuickSwitch> is a means to quickly and interactively change
the input focus to another window.  It is activated by pressing the
C<Alt+Tab> or C<Alt+Shift+Tab> key combination.  A window pops up
in the centre of the screen with a list of windows to choose from.
A narrow band indicates a selection: the candidate window that will
be activated to receive input focus when the Alt key is released.

The selection can be changed by repeatedly pressing the Tab key, while
keeping the Alt key down. If a Shift key is also down, the direction of
traversal is reversed. Or use the scroll wheel of the mouse.  Or use
one of the digit keys to select the corresponding window from the list.
Arrow keys are also supported, as well as the Home and End key.

To make a selected window the active window, just release the Alt key,
or hit the Return key, or click on it.  To cancel the QuickSwitch,
press Escape or click outside of the QuickSwitch window.

A selected window can be closed by Delete, C<Alt+F4>, or the middle
mouse button.  While the QuickSwitch window is up, one can still change
workspace with the usual workspace hotkeys.

The QuickSwitch has two distinct modes: vertical and horizontal.
The window list can include all windows or be limited to the current
workspace. There is an option to raise the selected candidate.
See the many preferences available for the QuickSwitch.

=head2 WINDOW PLACEMENT

A second important task of a window manager is to place new windows on
the screen.  By default B<icewm> chooses a placement with minimal
overlap, but this is determined by the C<SmartPlacement> option in the
F<preferences> file.  If C<SmartPlacement> is turned off then windows
are placed in sequence from left to right and top to bottom.  One can
also turn on C<ManualPlacement>.  Then new windows appear initially in
the top left corner and the mouse cursor changes into a fist.  By moving
the fist cursor to a suitable location and clicking the new window will
appear at the mouse click location.

=head2 WINDOW LAYERS

Windows can overlap.  Which window appears on top is determined by three
features.  Newer windows appear over older windows.  By clicking on a
window it is raised to the top.  But both are overruled by the window
layer.  Windows can be placed in different layers via the I<Layers>
menu.  Click with the right mouse button on the window frame and select
I<Layer>.  From there choose one of seven window layers.  These are
ordered from higher to lower.  Windows in higher layers appear over
windows in lower layers.

There are 16 layers in total, but most are seldom or never used. They
are numbered from zero for the lowest layer to fifteen for the topmost.
Their names with their layer number are: Desktop (0), Below (2), Normal
(4), OnTop (6), Dock (8), AboveDock (10), Menu (12), Fullscreen (14) and
AboveAll (15). By default every window appears in the I<Normal> layer.
Then I<Below> and I<OnTop> are used frequently to position windows below
or above most others. Icewm menus appear in the I<Menu> layer and the
I<Fullscreen> layer is reserved for windows in the fullscreen mode. The
default layer for each application can be set with a I<winoption>.

=head2 DOCKED APPLICATIONS

Icewm has native support for L<Window Maker dockapps|https://dockapps.net>.
It has a Dock container called B<DockApps>, which appears automatically
when dockapps are started. The position and layer of this container are
controlled by the C<DockApps> preference. It is a space separated list
of keywords. The keywords C<right, left, center, down, high> control the
position, while C<above, dock, ontop, normal, below, desktop> set the
layer. When B<DockApps> is set to the empty string, support for dockapps
is disabled. The dockapps in the container can be controlled using the
mouse when the B<Ctrl> key is pressed down. Drag with the left mouse
button, close with the middle mouse button, select a menu with the right
mouse button and rotate with the scroll wheel.

If maximizing a window should not overlap the I<DockApps> container, put
it in the I<dock> layer and set the preference B<LimitByDockLayer=1>.

=head2 TABBED WINDOWS

A window frame may contain multiple client windows. Only one client can
be visible, while the others are hidden. This is called tabbing.  This
can be helpful to reduce the number of visible windows. To create a tab,
drag the title bar with the middle mouse button, while holding down a
shift key, onto the title bar of another frame. The two title bars will
start to flash to indicate that they can merge. Release the mouse button
to merge the client of the upper window to the lower frame.  Now the
lower frame will have multiple clients, called tabs. The title bar will
show a vertical bar with triple dots to indicate this.
To change the current tab either:

=over

=item

Click on the triple dots next to the vertical bar.

=item

Use C<KeyWinNext=Alt+F6> to select the next tab.

=item

Use C<KeyWinPrev=Alt+Shift+F6> for the previous tab.

=item

Use the QuickSwitch.

=item

Use the window list window.

=item

Use a submenu in the window menu.

=back

To change the mouse binding for creating tabs, modify
B<MouseWinTabbing>=C<Shift+Pointer_Button2>.  Another
useful setting is B<MouseWinTabbing>=C<Pointer_Button1>.

C<Alt+F4> closes all tabs. To close just the active tab add to C<keys>:

    key "Ctrl+Shift+F4"     icesh -f close

To move the active tab to its own window frame by key, add to C<keys>:

    key "Alt+u"             icesh -f untab

To open all chrome windows in the same frame add this to C<winoptions>:

    google-chrome.frame:    chrome

=head2 WORKSPACES

B<icewm> supports multiple virtual desktops called workspaces.  A
workspace is like a screen where a subset of all application windows are
mapped.  Thanks to multiple workspaces we can more easily manage a
large number of applications.  The number of workspaces and their names
are configurable in the F<preferences> file through the
C<WorkspaceNames> option.  By default four workspaces are created
with the names 1, 2, 3 and 4 thus:

 WorkspaceNames=" 1 ", " 2 ", " 3 ", " 4 "

This syntax is typical for B<icewm> options that receive multiple
values.  It is a list of comma-separated values each of which can be
quoted.

The workspaces are visible on the toolbar.  One can switch to a
different workspace by pressing the workspace button in the toolbar,
but after becoming familiar with the 'keyboard shortcuts' below one will
want to use a hotkey to choose a workspace.  If the C<EdgeSwitch>
options is enabled in the F<preferences> file (with sub-options
C<HorizontalEdgeSwitch> and C<VerticalEdgeSwitch>) then one can move to
the next or previous workspace by moving the mouse to the edge of the
screen.  The C<ContinuousEdgeSwitch> option enables continuous movement
to subsequent workspaces.  The C<EdgeSwitchDelay> option says how long
to wait before a change of workspace occurs.

To move an application window to a different workspace one can use a
keyboard shortcut.  Another option is to select the I<Move To> submenu
in the window menu of the window frame.

=head2 DRAG AND DROP

The task bar supports drag and drop operations. When a drag
is in progress, the destination window can be activated by
hovering the drag icon over the task button for that window.
Alternatively, the current workspace can be changed by
hovering the drag icon over the desired workspace button.
When edge switching is enabled, the current workspace can
also be changed by bringing the drag icon to the screen edge.

=head2 ADDRESS BAR

The task bar contains a command-line prompt called the address bar,
if B<EnableAddressBar>=1. It is always shown when B<ShowAddressBar>=1,
otherwise it is activated by B<KeySysAddressBar>=C<Alt+Ctrl+space>.
In it a shell command can be typed. On I<Enter> it is executed by the
B<AddressBarCommand>=C</bin/sh>.  On I<Control+Enter> this command is
executed in a new terminal as given by B<TerminalCommand>.
I<Escape> cancels editing the address bar command.

Commands are executed relative to the working directory of icewm.
This is shown by C<pwd>. Change it with C<cd>.  Without argument C<cd>
defaults to the home directory. With one argument it is changed.
This argument is expanded when it starts with a dollar or tilde.
When it is equal to C<->, it reverts to the previous directory.

The address bar has a history that is navigable by I<Up> and I<Down>.
This history is saved in a file F<ahistory> in your icewm directory
and restored when icewm starts.

Completion is supported using I<Tab> or I<Ctrl+I>. The leading command
is completed from directories in your PATH, while file arguments are
expanded from the location in the file system. In addition usernames
and environment variables can also be expanded. For example, C<echo $TMP>
and I<Tab> may expand to C<echo $TMPDIR> and C<echo ~ro> and I<Tab> may
expand to C<echo ~root>.

The address bar implements cut/copy/paste and these editing operations:

=over

=item Ctrl+a: select all

=item Ctrl+backslash: deselect all

=item Ctrl+u: delete selected or to line start

=item Ctrl+v: paste selected

=item Ctrl+w: delete selected or previous word

=item Ctrl+x: cut selection

=item Ctrl+c: copy selection

=item Ctrl+i: completion

=item Ctrl+Left: back a word

=item Ctrl+Right: forward a word

=item Ctrl+Shift+Backspace: delete to beginning

=item Ctrl+Shift+Delete: delete to end

=item Ctrl+Delete: delete word

=item Ctrl+Backspace: delete previous word

=item Shift+Delete: cut selection

=item Shift+Insert: paste selected

=item Tab: completion

=item Left: move cursor left

=item Right: move cursor right

=item Home: move cursor to line start

=item End: move cursor to line end

=item Delete: delete next character

=item Backspace: delete previous character

=back

=head2 WINDOW LIST

The window list window shows a list of all workspaces. For each
workspace it shows the window titles of the windows that are mapped
on it. The bottom entry reads C<All Workspaces>. It holds the sticky
windows. These windows are mapped in all workspaces.

The window list window is normally hidden. Choose one of the following
four methods to make it visible:

=over

=item

Select the bottom window list menu entry.

=item

Press the C<KeySysWindowList=Ctrl+Alt+Esc> key.

=item

Press the right Windows key if C<Win95Keys=1>

=item

Press the C<DesktopWinListButton=2> mouse button in the root window.

=item

Press the middle mouse button in a workspace button on the task bar.

=back

A single-click on a window entry selects it. A group of windows can
be selected by C<Shift+Pointer_Button1> or by dragging with the left
mouse button. Use C<Ctrl+Pointer_Button1> to individually select
windows in a multi-selection. A right mouse click over a selection
will popup the system menu for this selection.  To close the selected
windows, press C<Delete>. Press C<Shift+Delete> to forcefully kill them.
Right mouse click below the sticky windows for a menu with window
arranging actions.

Double-click on a workspace to switch to it.  Double-click on a window
to activate it.  Or navigate by arrow keys and press Enter.
The space bar toggles a selection of a window. C<Ctrl+a> and C<Ctrl+/>
will select the entire list of windows. C<Ctrl+\\> deselects everything.
Press the first letter of a window title to navigate to it and select
it. If titles of multiple windows start with the same letter then
repeatedly pressing the first letter cycles over those windows.
C<Home> selects the first entry and C<End> the last. C<PageUp> and
C<PageDown> move up or down by ten entries. Combine this with the
C<Shift> key to extend a selection over the range of motion.

=head2 SYSTEM DIALOG

The system dialog offers quick access to a set of general controls.
It can lock the screen, suspend the system, logout or cancel a pending
logout, reboot the system, shutdown the system, show the window list,
restart icewm, show the about dialog, reload the winoptions file or
the keys file. It is activated by B<KeySysDialog>=C<Ctrl+Alt+Del>.
To cancel it, hit the Escape key.

=head2 MAILBOX MONITORING

The task bar can show one or more icons to reflect the status of a
mailbox. The mailbox can be a local file or a remote POP or IMAP
account. For this a couple of options must be set. First,
F<TaskBarShowMailboxStatus> must be enabled, which it is by default.
Then the location of the mailbox must be set.  Icewm first looks for
F<MailBoxPath> in preferences. If this is unset, it looks at the
environment variables C<MAILPATH> and C<MAIL>.  F<MailBoxPath> may
contain a space-separated list of mailboxes, while C<MAILPATH> may
contain a colon-separated list of mailboxes.  If a mailbox starts
with a slash C</>, then it is a local file, otherwise a URL.
These are six examples of possible mailboxes:

    file:///var/spool/mail/captnmark
    file:///home/captnmark/Maildir/
    pop3://markus:%2f%40%3a@maol.ch/
    pop3s://markus:password@pop.gmail.com/
    imap://mathias@localhost/INBOX.Maillisten.icewm-user
    imaps://mathias:password@imap.gmail.com/INBOX

The POP3S and IMAPS schemes use C<openssl> for TLS/SSL encryption.
Note that for IceWM to access Gmail you must first configure
your Gmail account to enable POP3 or IMAP access.
Make sure you have secure file permissions on your IceWM
preferences file and the directory that contains it.

Reserved characters in the password, like I<slash>, I<at> and I<colon>
can be specified using escape sequences with a hexadecimal encoding
like C<%2f> for the slash or C<%40> for the at sign.
For example, to hex-encode C<!p@a%s&s~> use this Perl snippet:

    perl -e 'foreach(split("", $ARGV[0])) { printf "%%%02x", ord($_); };
    print "\n";' '!p@a%s&s~'

Which will print:

    %21%40%23%24%25%5e%26%2a%7e

This is the hex-encoded password. However, it is unwise to store a
password in your preferences. Consider a wallet extension for IceWM.

IceWM will check a mailbox periodically. The period in seconds can
be set by the F<MailCheckDelay> option, which is 30 seconds by default.

Whenever new mail arrives, the mailbox icon will be highlighted.
The color will indicate if the mail has been read or not. Hovering
the mouse over the mailbox icon will show a tooltip with more details.
A command can be also be run on new mail. Set the F<NewMailCommand>
option. Its environment will have these variables set by IceWM:

=over

=item ICEWM_MAILBOX

The mailbox index number of F<MailBoxPath> starting from 1.

=item ICEWM_COUNT

The total number of messages in this mailbox.

=item ICEWM_UNREAD

The number of unread messages in this mailbox.

=back

=head2 KEYBOARD LAYOUT SWITCHING

To control keyboard layouts on the task bar, define in F<preferences>
the option B<KeyboardLayouts> to a comma-separated list of your
preferred keyboard layouts. For example:

  KeyboardLayouts = "de", "fr", "jp"

A keyboard layout can simply be a name. Usually this is a two-letter
country code. See the directory F</usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols> for
a list of available keyboard layouts for your system.  If it is
enclosed in double quotes, it can also be a space-separated list of
command-line arguments to an invocation of the C<setxkbmap> program.

The first layout is the default. It will be installed when icewm starts.
The task bar will show the current keyboard layout. If an icon can
be found for the first two letters of the layout, then that icon
will be shown. Otherwise the first two letters of the name of the
layout will be shown.

Click on the current keyboard layout to cycle through all the
available keyboard layouts, or use the B<KeySysKeyboardNext> key.
Click with the right mouse button to open a menu of all available
keyboard layouts.

It is also possible to configure a default keyboard layout for
each program individually in the L<icewm-winoptions(5)> file.
Whenever such a program receives input focus, icewm will install
this configured keyboard layout automatically. The keyboard status
on the task bar will be updated to reflect this.

Please note that for keyboard layout switching to work, the
C<setxkbmap> program must be installed. To see your current
keyboard layout settings, do C<setxkbmap -query>.

=head2 KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS

B<icewm> supports a large number of hotkeys to activate some behaviour
with a single key combination.  These are all configurable in the
F<preferences> file.  Here we give their preferences name, followed by
their default value in double quotes, and a short descriptions of their
effect.

Note that all use one or more key modifiers. Icewm supports the
following modifiers: Alt, AltGr, Ctrl, Hyper, Meta, Shift, Super.
Setting B<ModSuperIsCtrlAlt=1> makes the Super modifier an alias
for Ctrl+Alt.

=head2 MOUSE BINDINGS

You can control windows by a modified mouse button press:

=over

=item B<MouseWinMove>=C<Alt+Pointer_Button1>

Moves the window under the mouse over the screen.

=item B<MouseWinSize>=C<Alt+Pointer_Button3>

Resizes the window.  Keep the key and button pressed.
To enlarge the window move the mouse button away from the center.  To
shrink it move towards the centre.

=item B<MouseWinRaise>=C<Ctrl+Alt+Pointer_Button1>

Raises the window under the mouse.

=item B<MouseWinLower>=C<Ctrl+Alt+Pointer_Button1>

Lowers the window under the mouse.
If this is equal to C<MouseWinRaise> and the window can be raised
then C<MouseWinRaise> takes preference over C<MouseWinLower>.

=item B<MouseWinTabbing>="Shift+Pointer_Button2"

Mouse binding to create tabs.
Drag the title bar with this button over another title bar.
When they start to flash, release the button to merge the frame tabs.

=back

The title frame of a window also listens for mouse clicks.  A left
double-click maximizes the window (C<TitleBarMaximizeButton=1>).
When Shift is also pressed it only maximizes vertically.
Press Alt+Shift to maximize horizontally.

Middle double-clicking rolls up the window (C<TitleBarRollupButton=2>).
Also press Shift to maximize horizontally. If B<TitleBarRollupButton>
is either 4 or 5 then the scroll wheel controls rolling up or down.

Press a mouse button on the title bar and drag it to move the window.
To drag a maximized window, keep the Shift key down.
A C<Alt+Pointer_Button1> click in the title bar lowers the window.

When the mouse is on the window frame then a left click raises the
window.  Dragging with the left button down resizes the window.
Clicking the right button pops up the context menu.  Dragging with the
right button moves the window.

Double-clicking on the frame border (or corner) maximizes just that side
of the window. Another double-click restores that side. Double-clicking
on the border can also undo a maximization in that dimension.

Clicking on the desktop activates a menu.  The middle button shows the
window list (C<DesktopWinListButton=2>).  The right button shows the
root menu (C<DesktopMenuButton=3>). If you press C<Ctrl+Alt> then
the mouse wheel will focus all applications in turn.

=head2 SIGNALS

B<icewm> supports the following signals:

=over

=item B<SIGHUP>

B<icewm> will restart itself. It is a way to reload the configuration.

=item B<SIGINT>, B<SIGTERM>

B<icewm> will cease to manage application windows and terminate.

=item B<SIGQUIT>

B<icewm> will initiate the logout procedure.  If a C<LogoutCommand>
preferences option was configured it will be executed.

=item B<SIGUSR2>

Toggle the logging of X11 events, if C<logevents> was configured.

=back

=head2 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

=over

=item B<ICEWM_PRIVCFG>

The directory for user private configuration files.  When this
environment variable is not specified, the default directory is
F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/icewm> when that directory exists, otherwise the
default value is F<$HOME/.icewm>.

=item B<DISPLAY>

The name of the X11 server.  See L<Xorg(1)> or L<Xserver(1)>.  This
value can be overridden by the B<--display> option.

=item B<MAILPATH>, B<MAIL>

Gives the location of your mailbox.  If the schema is omitted the local
"file" schema is assumed.  This is used by the mailbox applet in the
task bar to show the status of your mailbox.  If the C<MailBoxPath>
option in the F<preferences> file is set, then that one takes
precedence.

=back

=head2 FILES

=head2 CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES

B<icewm> looks for configuration files in the following directories, in
the given order, until it finds one:

=over

=item F<$ICEWM_PRIVCFG/>

Contains user-specific configurations.  When B<ICEWM_PRIVCFG> is
specified, this directory takes precedence over
F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/icewm> and F<$HOME/.icewm>.

=item F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/icewm/>

Contains user-specific configurations.  When this directory exists it
take precedence over F<$HOME/.icewm>.

=item F<$HOME/.icewm/>

Contains user-specific configurations.  This is the historical default
directory.

=item F</etc/icewm/>

Contains system-wide customized defaults.  Please note that your local
installation may have been configured to use a different system
location.  The output of C<icewm --directories> will show this location.

=item F</usr/share/icewm/>

Default local installation settings.

=back

=head2 CONFIGURATION FILES

=over

=item F<env>

L<icewm-session(1)> loads additional environment variables from the file
F<env>.  Each line is subjected to POSIX shell expansion by
L<wordexp(3)>.  Comment lines starting by a hash-sign (C<#>) are ignored.
L<icewm-session(1)> will load those expanded lines that contain a name,
followed by an equals sign, followed by the value (which may be empty).

See L<icewm-env(5)>.

=item F<focus_mode>

Defines the initial value for C<FocusMode>.  Its default value is
C<FocusMode=1> (Click-to-focus).  This can be changed via the menu.
B<icewm> will save the Focus menu choice in this file.

See L<icewm-focus_mode(5)>.

=item F<keys>

Global keybindings to launch applications, which need not be window
manager related.  Each non-empty line starts with the word C<key>.
After one or more spaces follows a double-quoted string of the bound X11
key combination like C<Alt+Ctrl+Shift+X>.  Then after at least one space
follows a shell command-line that will be executed by B<icewm> whenever
this key combination is pressed.  For example, the following line
creates a hotkey to reload the B<icewm> configuration:

 key "Ctrl+Shift+r"      icesh restart

See L<icewm-keys(5)>.

=item F<menu>

A menu of applications; usually customized by the user.  B<icewm>
provides the L<icewm-menu-fdo(1)> program to generate a default menu.
Similar programs are L<xdg_menu(1)>, L<mmaker(1)> (MenuMaker),
L<xde-menu(1)>, L<xdgmenumaker(1)>.

See L<icewm-menu(5)>.

=item F<preferences>

Contains general settings like paths, colors and fonts, but also options
to control the B<icewm> focus behaviour and the applets that are
started in the task bar.  The B<icewm> installation will provide a
default F<preferences> file, which can be copied to the B<icewm> user
configuration directory and modified.

See L<icewm-preferences(5)>.

=item F<prefoverride>

Settings which override the settings from a theme.  Some of the B<icewm>
configuration options from the preferences file that control the
look-and-feel may be overridden by the theme, if the theme designer
thinks this is desirable.  However, this F<prefoverride> file will again
override this for a few specific options of your choosing.  It is safe
to leave this file empty initially.

See L<icewm-prefoverride(5)>.

=item F<programs>

An automatically generated menu of applications.  This could be used by
L<wmconfig(1)>, menu or similar programs to give easy access to all the
desktop applications that are installed on the system.

See L<icewm-programs(5)>.

=item F<theme>

This file contains the name of the default theme.  On startup B<icewm>
reads this file to obtain the theme name, unless B<icewm> was started
with the B<--theme> option.  Whenever a different theme is selected from
the B<icewm> Menu then the theme file is overwritten with the name of
the selected theme.  This theme file contains the keyword C<Theme>,
followed by an equals sign, followed by a double-quoted string with the
theme name.  The theme name is the name of the theme directory, followed
by a slash, followed by the theme file.  Usually the theme file is just
F<default.theme>, but a theme may have alternatives.  Alternatives are
small tweaks of a theme.  These are specified in their own F<.theme>
file, which replaces F<default.theme>.  If no theme file exists then
B<icewm> will use the default setting of
C<Theme="default/default.theme">.

See L<icewm-theme(5)>.

=item F<toolbar>

Contains names of quick to launch applications with icons for the task
bar.  Each non-empty non-comment line starts with the keyword B<prog>.
After one or more spaces follows a name, which is displayed in a tool
tip whenever the mouse cursor hovers over the toolbar icon.  This name
may be a double quoted string.  Then follows the bare name of the icon
to use without extensions.  This icon will be shown in the toolbar.  The
last component is a shell command-line that will be executed whenever
the user presses the icon in the toolbar.  For example, the following
line in toolbar will create a button with tool tip C<Mozilla Firefox>
with the F<firefox> icon that launches L<firefox(1)> when clicked:

 prog  "Mozilla Firefox"  firefox  /usr/bin/firefox --private-window

See L<icewm-toolbar(5)>.

=item F<winoptions>

Contains settings to control window appearance and behaviour that are
specific to applications or groups of applications.  Options can control
the border, whether it appears on the task bar, the window list, the
system tray and the workspaces.  Also its layer, geometry, whether it
can be moved, resized and closed.

See L<icewm-winoptions(5)>.

=item F<startup>

Contains commands to be executed on B<icewm> startup.  This is an
executable script with commands to tweak X11 settings and launch some
applications that need to be active whenever B<icewm> is started.
It is run by L<icewm-session(1)> when B<icewm> starts.

See L<icewm-startup(5)>.

=item F<shutdown>

Contains commands to be executed on B<icewm> shutdown.  This is an
executable script with commands to be executed in the last stage of
B<icewm> termination.  Typically they may undo some of the effects of
the F<startup> script.  It is run by L<icewm-session(1)> when B<icewm>
terminates.

See L<icewm-shutdown(5)>.

=back

=head2 CONFIGURATION SUBDIRECTORIES

=over

=item F<cursors>

May contain cursor icons in the XPM image format. These overrule cursors
provided by a theme. There are 3 direction cursors: F<left.xpm>,
F<right.xpm>, F<move.xpm>, 8 resize cursors: F<sizeR.xpm>, F<sizeTR.xpm>,
F<sizeT.xpm>, F<sizeTL.xpm>, F<sizeL.xpm>, F<sizeBL.xpm>, F<sizeB.xpm>,
F<sizeBR.xpm>, and 4 scroll cursors: F<scrollL.xpm>, F<scrollR.xpm>,
F<scrollU.xpm>, and F<scrollD.xpm>.
By default an XPM header defines four dimensions: width, height, colors
and chars-per-pixel. For cursors this must be extended to six. The last
two are the I<x-hotspot> and the I<y-hotspot>. These define which point
in the XPM image is the sensitive point for the mouse pointer.

=item F<icons>

Contains icons for applications and keyboard layouts. These can be in
XPM, PNG or SVG format.  The filename of an I<application icon> may
follow a specific naming pattern, like F<app_32x32.xpm>.  They start
with a base name, which usually is just a single word.  Then follows
an underscore, followed by a size specification, as in C<SIZExSIZE>.
This is followed by a dot and the file extension, where the extension
denotes the icon image format.  Common sizes are 16, 32 and 48.
This depends on the respective C<IconSize> preferences options.

=item F<ledclock>

Pictures of digits for the LED clock which is displayed in the
bottom-right corner of the task bar.  These can be seen when the
C<TaskBarShowClock> and C<TaskBarClockLeds> options are both set to 1.

=item F<mailbox>

Icons that are used to display different states of the mailbox applet
in the task bar.  There are five states and each has its own icon:
F<mail.xpm>, F<newmail.xpm>, F<unreadmail.xpm>, F<nomail.xpm>,
F<errmail.xpm>.

=item F<sounds>

Audio files that are played by L<icesound(1)> on GUI events.  These
are: F<startup.wav>, F<shutdown.wav>, F<restart.wav>, F<launchApp.wav>,
F<workspaceChange.wav>, F<windowOpen.wav>, F<windowClose.wav>,
F<dialogOpen.wav>, F<dialogClose.wav>, F<windowMax.wav>,
F<windowRestore.wav>, F<windowMin.wav>, F<windowHide.wav>,
F<windowRollup.wav>, F<windowMoved.wav>, F<windowSized.wav>,
F<windowLower.wav>.

=item F<taskbar>

Pictures to customize the look of the task bar.  These include:
F<taskbarbg.xpm>, F<taskbuttonactive.xpm>, F<taskbuttonbg.xpm>,
F<taskbuttonminimized.xpm>, F<toolbuttonbg.xpm>,
F<workspacebuttonactive.xpm>, F<workspacebuttonbg.xpm>.

=item F<themes>

A directory to store themes.  Each theme is stored in its own
sub-directory in the F<themes> directory. A theme contains at least a
F<default.theme> file, and optionally theme alternatives which are
additional files that have a F<.theme> file name extension and that
contain tweaks of the F<default.theme> file.
How to create a theme is explained in the
L<IceWM Theme Creation Howto|https://ice-wm.org/themes>.

=item F<workspace>

If C<PagerShowPreview> is disabled, icewm looks in the C<workspace>
directory for images to draw on a workspace button. The image filename
should have the name of the workspace. The image extension is optional.

=back

=head2 OPACITY

IceWM supports window opacity and transparency in connection with an
external compositor like L<compton(1)> or L<picom(1)>.
If a client window sets the C<_NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY> property on
its window, then B<icewm> will copy this to the outer frame window,
where the compositor will read it and adjust the opacity accordingly.

The opacity can also be set in the L<icewm-winoptions(5)> file.
L<icesh(1)> can control the opacity level of running applications.

The _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE properties that B<icewm> sets on its windows
are I<DIALOG>, I<NOTIFICATION>, I<POPUP_MENU> and I<TOOLTIP>. The output
of C<icesh windows> shows their WM_CLASS values. These can be helpful
to configure compton.

=head2 EXAMPLES

Examples of the above configuration files can be found in the default
installation path or in the system-wide defaults.  See the output of
C<icewm --directories> for their locations.
